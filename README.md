# Number-System-Conversion
Convert between the decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal number systems.

Bear in mind this is an ongoing and unfinished project. 

I intend the final product to be able to receive the user's input for the original value, as well as the current and target number bases, and to output the converted value.

Floating point numbers are accepted.
